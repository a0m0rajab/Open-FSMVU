# Welcome to Open-FSMVU

This is a starter project for a future open source project lead by student of FSMVU university.

## why this project?

- it will help any student in the world to learn computer engineering online.
- it provides the basic information about Computer Engineering major for those who have not read or know about it before. 
- provide an interactive learning atmosphere between instructors and student by making everything clear to them.
- Make it clear about what is taught at university
- Help other students in the future to share their lessons, classes and write their own materials. 
- Be a guide for future students at my university to get better understanding and grades


# Fatih Sultan Mehmet University 
FSMVU is a university based in Tukrey teaches a few Majors like Computer Engineering and Biyomedical Engineering.

# How to use this Guide 
This Guide made to show the Curriculum of Computer engineering major in the university and how to study it online, Extra files can be found to show the homeworks and Lessons materials.

It will be a base for other students as well to get insights and ideas about the university.

The best way to use it is by checking the needed section and read whatever is provided there.

# Computer Engineering 
is a four year practical program.



## First year
In the first year you learn the basic programming syntax and Main university courses related to engineering like Mathematics .
